# Conditionals

Conditionals are used to control the flow of data points through your program. They are used to introduce logical paths that are used to navigate functions.

## Boolean Operators

[Boolean operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression#Boolean_operators) are used for evaluating statements that result in boolean conditions. Operators include `&&`(and), `||`(or), `>`(greater than), `>=`(greater than or equal to), `<` (less than), `<=`(less than or equal to), `!=`(does not equal), `!` (not), and `==`(equal to). 

Now would be a good time for us to experiment with these operators. In your browser navigate to our favorite go text editor [go playspace](https://goplay.space/). Let's start buy evaluating some statements. We will start with something that we know is true. In your file change your `main` function to resemble the following.

```go 
func main() {
	fmt.Println(1 < 2)
}
```

When you run the this code you should see the boolean value printed of `true` or `false`. Since 2 is in fact larger number than 1 we expect this statement `1 < 2` to be evaluated to `true`. If that is printed below we win!!!

Now let us try to anticipate the result. Copy and paste the following into your [playspace](https://goplay.space/) replacing your `main` function. Replace underlined portion with your guess of what you think the boolean statement will evaluate too. 

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 >= 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 < 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 == 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 != 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
}
```

<!-- Do I need to explain &&| //--> 
And just for funzies we will try one more set of guessercises. A little more complicated. Feel free to put these into your [playspace](https://goplay.space/) and guess the result. They will be a little more complicated.

```go

func main() {
	fmt.Println(true && false)
	fmt.Println(true && true)
	fmt.Println(false && false)
	fmt.Println(false && true)

	fmt.Println(true || false)
	fmt.Println(true || true)
	fmt.Println(false || false)
	fmt.Println(false || true)
}
```

Here we used the `&&` operator. This boolean statement will only return true the conditions on **BOTH** sides of the operator are met. The other operator we used `||` returns true when **EITHER** condition on each side of the operator is met.

# Control Flow

Sometimes we are writing new code we have to use boolean conditions and logic to define certain behavior. This is called _Control Flow_. Essential we use the conditions to control when certain bits of code are run. 

Here is an example from the [Go standard Library](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ba76567bc2500204432ed8a5cb28848410e74447/src/container/list/list.go#L31). You don't have to know what it means now. There may be some syntaxes we have not covered yet. No worries, by the end of this section you should be able to read through this code and understand the conditions that have to be met for the code to be executed. 

```go 
func (s *ss) Token(skipSpace bool, f func(rune) bool) (tok []byte, err error) {
	defer func() {
		if e := recover(); e != nil {
			if se, ok := e.(scanError); ok {
				err = se.err
			} else {
				panic(e)
			}
		}
	}()
	if f == nil {
		f = notSpace
	}
	s.buf = s.buf[:0]
	tok = s.token(skipSpace, f)
	return
}
```

## If statements

My personal opinion is that `if` statement of the most powerful conditional statement in the Go programming language. It is used every where. Take a look at this random snippet from the [Go standard lib.](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/fmt/scan.go#L247) I know that is overwhelming and if you are new to development you may not understand to much, but that is ok. Nobody expects you to know what the heck is going on. Just take a quick second to count how many if statements are found on the page. Super powerful. 

If statements take a boolean condition and run the code contained by the if statement only when the condition is met. Let's explore this in code!!! 

**Problem:**

>> Pulp Fiction is having a special viewing at your local movie theater to help encourage movie theater attendance in a post COVID-19 world. The movie theater has an age restriction on who can purchase tickets. We need to write a function that tells us if customer is old enough to purchase a ticket. 

In your `main` function start by defining a variable called age. Set the age variable to any number. Now let us define the `if` statement. Below your age, paste the following.
```go
if age >= 17 {
fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket)
}
```
When you run your code, if the age condition is met you should see the sentence printed out. If the condition isn't met nothing is printed.


If statements are powerful tools in go. Here is a selection from the [go standard library](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/f5e6d3e879f487066d1a05b8000a7187247558f7/test/codegen/condmove.go#L214) (the go language code). 


_**NOTE**:
You don't have to know what this code is supposed to do. It is a single function in a large library. With time code snippets like this will make a lot of sense_


```go
func cmovinc(cond bool, a, b, c int) {
	var x0, x1 int

	if cond {
		x0 = a
	} else {
		x0 = b + 1
	}
	// arm64:"CSINC\tNE", -"CSEL"
	r0 = x0

	if cond {
		x1 = b + 1
	} else {
		x1 = a
	}
	// arm64:"CSINC\tEQ", -"CSEL"
	r1 = x1

	if cond {
		c++
	}
	// arm64:"CSINC\tEQ", -"CSEL"
	r2 = c
}
```

Notice how the `if` statements are sometimes by themselves and at other times they are followed by additional `else` statements. This is called [Control Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Choice). The next few sections of this lesson will address control flow in Go.

## Else Statements

An else statement used to define a certain type of flow. It follows your typical if -> then scenarios. If the condition of the `if` statement is not met then run the code contained in the `else` statement.

Let's try using an `else` statement in the movie theater problem.

**Problem:**

The local movie theater now wants to recommend *The Princess Bride* for all viewers who are under 17. 

Let's start with our old code. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
		age := 21
		if age >= 17 {
				fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket)
		}
}
```
We just need to add an `else` statement to recommend *The Princess Bride.*

```go
		if age >= 17 {
			fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Why don't you try the Princess Bride instead")
		}
```
What happens when you change the age from 21 to 16? Does it print the right line of code? 

*PRO TIP: Expected Behavior is when code does what you expect it to do. The outcome of a simple function should always have an 
expected behavior. If it does something you don't expect then it is most likely in need of a rewrite. (In [part_5](part_5/5.2_unit_tests.md) we will
explore using tests to define Expected Behavior.*

## Else If Statements

Sometimes when programming we are given problems where we have to define multiple patterns of behavior based on met conditions. We are going to 
continue using the *movie theater* problem to explore this. 

**Problem:**

The local movie theater has noticed that some small children do not enjoy watching *The Princess Bride*. The movie theater wants to offer tickets
to *The Little Mermaid* for patrons who are 7 years old and younger. 

How do we do this?

Using only the tools we have so far the code might look something like this. 

```go 
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	age := 21 
	if age >= 17 {
		fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket")
	} else {
		if age <= 7 {
			fmt.Println("Would you like to watch The Little Mermaid")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Why don't you try The Princess Bride instead")
		}
	}

}
```

This works, but doesn't this look kinda gross? This code is hard to read and hard to know what the expected behavior is supposed to be. When code is hard to read the first thing we should ask ourselves is if there is better way to write this? 

In Go, and most programming language, there is a construct called [`else if`](https://gobyexample.com/if-else) that allows us to write this is a more readable way. `else if` allows us to add additional condition checks to an `if else` statement. For example: 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	age := 21
	if age >= 17 {
		fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket")
	} else if age <= 7 {
		fmt.Println("Would you like to watch the Little Mermaid")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Why don't you try the Princess Bride instead")
	}
}
```

That was so much easier. We can add as many `else if` conditions as needed. 

## Switch Statements

Personally, I do not use `else if` statements when programming is Go. I rarely use `else` statements. In Go there is another control flow construct called a [`Switch Statement`](https://gobyexample.com/switch). The `switch` statement like `if else` uses conditions to define a programs behavior. Let's use the previous example and apply it to our switch statement. 

We ended with this chunk of code inside our if statement.

```go
	age := 21
	if age >= 17 {
		fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket")
	} else if age <= 7 {
		fmt.Println("Would you like to watch the Little Mermaid")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Why don't you try the Princess Bride instead")
	}
```

All of the logic we have in this code depends  on the value of the `age` variable. The syntax of the `switch` statement highlights the dependency on a certain variable and uses the syntax of a `case` define the conditions that guide the code's behavior. There is also a case called `default` that is to run when none of the conditions are met. Here is what the code would look like as a `switch` statement:

```go
	age := 21
	switch {
	case age >= 17:
		fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket")
	case age <= 7:
		fmt.Println("Would you like to watch the Little Mermaid")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Why don't you try the Princess Bride instead")
	}
```

## Exercise

_It is time to apply what we have learned so far in an exercise. Take the provided code and fill the missing function._

The movie theater had so much success from the last event that they want us to help with another. They want to invite groups/families into the theater for a Sci-fi movie marathon. They have several packages of different movies that they want to recommend based on the youngest member of the group. Here are the following movie groups 

Ages 0-5:
- Wall-e
- The Lego Movie
- Lilo and Stitch

Ages 5-10
- The Lego Movie
- Star Wars
- Home
- Back To the Future

Ages 10-13:
- Star Wars
- E.T.
- Back To the Future
- Ghostbusters


Ages 13-17:
- Star Wars
- Guardians of the Galaxy
- Interstellar
- Arrival

Ages 17+:
- Star Wars
- Aliens
- The Matrix
- The Terminator

Your job is to write a function that returns the appropriate list based on the age of the youngest member of the family/group.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func getMovies(age int) []string {
	movies0to5 := []string{"Wall-e", "The Lego Movie", "Lilo and Stitch"}
	movies5to10 := []string{"The Lego Movie", "Star Wars", "Home", "Back To the Future"}
	movies10to13 := []string{"Star Wars", "E.T.", "Back To the Future", "Ghostbusters"}
	movies13to17 := []string{"Star Wars", "Guardians of the Galaxy", "Interstellar", "Arrival"}
	moves17up := []string{"Star Wars", "Aliens", "The Matrix", "The Terminator"}

	// put code here ...

}

func main() {
	movies := getMovies(21)
	fmt.Printf("Here is your movie list based on age: %v+", movies)
}
```

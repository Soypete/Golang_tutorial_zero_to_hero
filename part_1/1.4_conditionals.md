# Conditionals
Conditionals are used to control the flow if data points through your program. They are used to introduce logical paths that are used to navigate functions.

## Boolean Operators

[Boolean operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression#Boolean_operators) are used for evaluating statements that result in boolean conditions. Operators include `&&`(and), `||`(or), `>`(greater than), `>=`(greater than or equal to), `<` (less than), `<=`(less than or equal to), `!=`(does not equal), `!` (not), and `==`(equal to). 

Now would be a good time for us to experiment with these operators. In your browser navigate to our favorite go text editor [go playspace](https://goplay.space/). Let's start buy evaluating some statements. We will start with something that we know is true. In your file change your `main` function to resemble the following.
```go 
func main() {
	fmt.Println(1 < 2)
}
```
When you run the this code you should see the boolean value printed of `true` or `false`. Since 2 is in fact larger number than 1 we expect this statement `1 < 2` to be evaluated to `true`. If that is printed below we win!!!

Now let us try to anticipate the result. Copy and paste the following into your [playspace](https://goplay.space/) replacing your `main` function. Replace underlined portion with your guess of what you think the boolean statement will evaluate too. 
```go
func main() {
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 >= 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 < 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 == 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
	fmt.Printf("the statement 2 != 3 is %v I guess _____ \n", 2 >= 3)
}
```

<!-- Do I need to explain &&| //--> 
And just for funzies we will try one more set of guessercises. A little mire complicated. Feel free to put these into your [playspace](https://goplay.space/) and guess the result. They will be a little more complicated.
```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println(true && false)
	fmt.Println(true && true)
	fmt.Println(false && false)
	fmt.Println(false && true)

	fmt.Println(true || false)
	fmt.Println(true || true)
	fmt.Println(false || false)
	fmt.Println(false || true)
}
```

## If statements
My personal opinion is that `if` statement of the most powerful conditional statement in the Go programming language. It is used every where. Take a look at this random snippet from the [Go standard lib.](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ba76567bc2500204432ed8a5cb28848410e74447/src/container/list/list.go#L31) I know that is overhelming and if you are new to development you may not understand to much, but that is ok. Nobody expects you to know what the heck is going on. Just take a quick second to count how many if statements are found on the page. Super powerful. 

If statements take a boolean condition and run the code contained by the if statement only when the condition is met. Let's explore this in code!!! 

Problem: 
>> Pulp Fiction is having a special viewing at your local movie theater to help encourage movie theater attendance in a post COVID-19 world. The movie theater has an age restriction on who can purchase tickets. We need to write a function that tells us if customer is old enough to purchase a ticket. 

In your `main` function start by defining a variable called age. Set the age variable to any number. now let us define the `if statement`. Below your age, paste the following.
```go
if age >= 17 {
fmt.Println("You are allowed to buy a ticket)
}
```
When you run your code, if the age condition is met you should see the sentence printed out. If the condition isn't met nothing is printed.

# Types in Golang
In the first exercise we printed out a statement. This statement has a certain type; it was a `string`. `Strings` are generally anything that we consider to be written word, or plain English. 

### Basic Types

They are other variable types that come up quite often when you write go code. Here is a list of basic types: 
-`string`: A statement or sentence. This us denoted by a set of quotes `""` or `''`
-`char`: A single letter or character. This is denoted by a set of quotes `''`. example: `'a'`
-`byte`: Hexidecimal values used to express information. example: `bd b2 3d bc 20 e2 8c 98`
-`int`: A positive or negative number that does not contain a decimal. The max value for an `int` can be `1<<15 - 1` and the min is `-1<<15 - 1`
-`double`: A positive or negative number that contains up to two decimal points. 
-`float32`: Any number more complex than and `int` or `double`.
-`bool`: Stores a state of condition. It can be either `true` or `false`.
-`error`: `stores error messages that alert the developer to broken code. 

There are many more go types than that, but these are the ones that you will most often be exposed to as a golang developer.

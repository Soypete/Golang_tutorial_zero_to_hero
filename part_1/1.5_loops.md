# Loops

Now to continue our discussion on control flow. Let's start with a problem. 

*Problem*
You and your friends are getting together for a Harry Potter Marathon and you want to use your new programming skills to find the total run time of all the movies so you know how long your marathon will be. Using your go skills you have compiled a list of all the movies. Now define a function to calculate your movies.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var HarryPotter = []Movie{
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 152,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 161,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 142,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 157,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 129,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 153,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 146,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 130,
	},
}

func CaculateWatchTime(movies []Movie) int {
	// add you code here
}

func main (){
	time := CaculateWatchTime(HarryPotter)
	fmt.Println("The total run time is %d minutes")

```

A naive first time approach might have a `CalculateWatchTime()` that looks like this.

```go
func CaculateWatchTime(movies []Movie) int {
	movie1time := movies[0].TimeInMinutes
	movie2time := movies[1].TimeInMinutes
	movie3time := movies[2].TimeInMinutes
	movie4time := movies[3].TimeInMinutes
	movie5time := movies[4].TimeInMinutes
	movie6time := movies[5].TimeInMinutes
	movie7time := movies[6].TimeInMinutes
	movie8time := movies[7].TimeInMinutes
	totalTime := movie1Time + movie2Time + movie3Time + movie4Time + movie5Time + movie6Time + movie7Time + movie8Time
	return totalTime
}
```

That is a lot of code. It would almost be faster to do the math by hand. Good news we can make this a lot simpler.

## For loop

`For loops` are a tool that we use to simplifiy the above code. More formally _In computer science, a for-loop (or simply for loop) is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly._[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop) 
In layman's terms, we loop over a bit of code over and over again. This allow us to save us from extra typing, excesive copy and pasting, and superfluos code. It also empowers you as a programmer to do complex algorithms with just a few lines of code. 

### c++ style

Let's take the above problem and implement the code with a traditional c++ style `for loop`. This style of `for loop` traditionally takes this form:

``` go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {}
```

This code starts by defining what we call an _index_ which is used to keep track of what iteration of the code we are on and how many have been run. Our index is `i` and start at 0. We see that this _index_ is defined right after the `for loop` is declared using the key word `for`. The next part of the declaration contains the number of iterations that will take place. `i < 10` is use to say _we want this code to run 10 times_. The last part defines how big our step size will be. We want to step through every number so our step side is 1. 

Here are some code examples. For practice try changing what the index starts at, the number of iterations, and the step size.

```go 
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	// base example
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("My favorite number is: %d", i)
	}
	
	// starts at 1
	for i := i; i <= 10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("My favorite number is: %d", i)
	}

	// change step size
	for i := 0; i < 10; i = i + 2 {
		fmt.Printf("My favorite number is: %d", i)
	}
	}
```	

### Slices

Many programming languages, like Go, have a code syntax that allows you to write a `for loop` that iterates over the values in a slice. This is very helpful when you don't necesarily know how long the slice is or you don't how many iterations will need to take place.

*Practice*: re-write the code from the practice example using one of the `for loop` styles. 

*Pro-Tip* 
we can get a number value for the length of a slice by using the `len()` expression. So if we don't know the length of a slice at compile time we can use the `len()` expression to handle this in the code. for example the length of `movies` can be written as `len(movies)`. For the `Harry Potter` example that equals 8. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var HarryPotter = []Movie{
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 152,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 161,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 142,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 157,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 129,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 153,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 146,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 130,
	},
}

func CaculateWatchTime(movies []Movie) int {
	// add you code here
}

func main (){
	time := CaculateWatchTime(HarryPotter)
	fmt.Println("The total run time is %d minutes")

```

### Using Condition (while loop)

Sometimes we want a bit of code to run until a certain boolean condition is met. This specific construct is called a [`while loop`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop). In Go the `while loop` follows the `for loop` syntax. It is constructed by starting with key word `for` followed by our condition and then a set of curly braces.

```go 
for _condition {
	// code here
}
``` 

Below is an example of a `while loop` that you can run.

**Example**
We want to build an app that calculates the number of days left until school is out. Run this code and make sure you under stand what it says. If you don't know what the code says check out these resources. 

- [time package](https://golang.org/pkg/time)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func GetDaysLeftOfSchool(startMonth, endMonth, endDay int, isFullYear bool) int {
	// the the current year
	year, month, _ := time.Now().UTC().Date()
	endYear := year

	// check if we need to add a year to the end day
	if isFullYear && startMonth >= 7 && month >= 7 {
		endYear++
		fmt.Println(endYear)
	}

	// start counter
	dateTracker := time.Now().UTC()
	var daysLeftOfSchool int

	// this continues to run until the endDay and the endMonth match the days we are adding .to
	for dateTracker.Day() != endDay || dateTracker.Month() != time.Month(endMonth) {

		// add one day to dateTracker
		dateTracker = dateTracker.AddDate(0, 0, 1)

		// add one daty to days left
		daysLeftOfSchool++
	}

	// return days left
	return daysLeftOfSchool
}

func main(){
	daysLeft := GetDaysLeftOfSchool(8, 5, 25, true)
	fmt.Printf("There are %d days left of school", daysLeft)
}

```

*NOTE: Forever Loop*

A forever loop is a loop in which the condition is not met. This can result in conditions when certain parts of your code are not run. I would recommend that you avoid this kind of loop until you have more experience writing code. Here is some more information [Your Basic Golang: Loops](https://yourbasic.org/golang/for-loop/#infinite-loop).

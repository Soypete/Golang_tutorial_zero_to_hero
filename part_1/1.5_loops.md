# Loops

Now to continue our discussion on control flow. Let's start with a problem. 

*Problem*
You and your friends are getting together for a Harry Potter Marathon and you want to use your new programming skills to find the total run time of all the movies so you know how long your marathon will be. Using your go skills you have compiled a list of all the movies. Now define a function to calculate your movies.

```go
package main
import "fmt"
var HarryPotter = []Movie{
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 152,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 161,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban",
		Rating:        "PG",
		TimeInMinutes: 142,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 157,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 129,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 153,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 146,
	},
	{
		Name:          "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2",
		Rating:        "PG - 13",
		TimeInMinutes: 130,
	},
}

func CaculateWatchTime(movies []Movie) int {
// add you code here
}

func main (){
	time := CaculateWatchTime(HarryPotter)
	fmt.Println("The total run time is %d minutes")

```

A naive first time approach might have a `CalculateWatchTime()` that looks like this.

```go
func CaculateWatchTime(movies []Movie) int {
movie1time := movies[0].TimeInMinutes
movie2time := movies[1].TimeInMinutes
movie3time := movies[2].TimeInMinutes
movie4time := movies[3].TimeInMinutes
movie5time := movies[4].TimeInMinutes
movie6time := movies[5].TimeInMinutes
movie7time := movies[6].TimeInMinutes
movie8time := movies[7].TimeInMinutes
totalTime := movie1Time + movie2Time + movie3Time + movie4Time +movie5Time +movi6Time + mvie7Timee + moviee8Time
return totalTime
}
```

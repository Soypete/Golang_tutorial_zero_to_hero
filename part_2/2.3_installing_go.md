# Installing Go


## Windows
### From Binary
The easiest way to install Go is by going to [the install page](https://golang.org/doc/install) and downloading and running the installer. It will setup your path and everything for you.

If you know what Chocolatey is and already have it installed, you can also use it to install go via the `golang` package, but this is not recommended.

Once installed, restart your bash terminal entirely and `go version` should work in your new terminal.

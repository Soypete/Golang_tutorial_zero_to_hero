## What is Source Control?
Source control is a way of capturing history of a collection of text files in a way that can be collaborated upon. It is pretty easy to think of it as if you were saving every "undo" step when editing a document or spreadsheet into a log, and then sharing that log with others editing the same thing alongside you.

There's a lot to dive into there that won't matter at this juncture, so for now while you work on your own repo alone, it's worth just keeping in mind that it's just version history you can interact with as you need to.

## Install git
It is time to open your terminal and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Although version control can be run through many IDEs and some text editors like VSCode, it is really go to get familiar with the CLI commands.
